# Provisional MRG

A **Provisional MRG** is a set of [provisional MRG entries](@), to which such [entries](provisional-mrg-entry@) can be added, removed or modified, as specified by [term selection instructions](@), and that are ultimately [further processed](mrgt#post-processing@) to result in a proper [MRG](@).

The list of [term selection instructions](@) that are used to create a [provisional MRG](@) (and ultimately a proper [MRG](@)) are in the [`versions` section](/docs/specs/files/saf#versions) of the [SAF](@) of the [scope](@) of which the [MRG](@) is a part.
