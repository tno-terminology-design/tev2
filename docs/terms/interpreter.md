# Interpreter

An **interpreter** is a [regex](@) that is used to locate a particular text construct (such as a [TermRef](@) or [MRGRef](@)) in a text, and that populates [named capturing groups](@) as specified in the [interpreter profile](@) of the particular [text conversion tool](@) for which it is designed.

The [specifications](toolbox@) of the particular [tool](text-conversion-tool@) tell you which [interpreters](@) are predefined for that [tool](text-conversion-tool@), and what the [interpreter profile](@) is that a customized [interpreter](@) may use.

:::info Editor's note
We could perhaps add references to appropriate sections of relevant tools, so that readers can see examples of this.
:::

The generic workings of interpreters is documented in the [TEv2 Text Conversion pattern](/docs/overview/tev2-text-conversion).
