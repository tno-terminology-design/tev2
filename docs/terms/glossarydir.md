# Glossarydir

A **Glossarydir** is a directory within a [scopedir](@) within which the different versions of its ([machine readable](mrg@) [glossaries](@) are created and maintained.

Typically a [glossarydir](@) would contain an [MRG](@) for every version of a [terminology](@) as specified in the [scope's](@) [SAF](@). 

The [glossarydir](@) may also contain other files, such as [HRGs](@), templates for the creation of [HRGs](@), or headers, footers or other things that are necessary for generating specific [glossaries](@).

The location of the [glossarydir](@) of a [scope](@) is specified in the [SAF](@) of that [scope](@) (which is located in the root of the [scopedir](@)).
