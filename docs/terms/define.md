# Define

To **define** is to provide a clear and precise explanation of a concept or term, including its essential characteristics, to establish a shared understanding among a community working together on a particular set of [objectives](@essif-lab). This is done by:
1. providing a criterion, where the criterion can be used by people to determine whether or not something is an instance/example of a [concept](@) (or other [semantic unit](@))
2. providing a [term](@), that is proposed for the purpose of referring to that [concept](@) itself, or an arbitrary instance thereof.

 Defining concepts accurately, i.e., providing a criterion that precisely makes the proper distinction  is crucial for effective communication and collaboration within the community.

### Examples

- In the context of a scientific research community, researchers define domain-specific terms to ensure that their work is based on a shared understanding of key concepts, promoting consistency in publications and discussions.
- When developing a software product, a team of engineers defines technical terms and their functionalities, ensuring that all team members interpret these terms consistently throughout the development process.
- In a legal context, lawyers define terms that are particular to a regulation (and document them as one of the clauses therein), ensuring that legal arguments can be based on terms of which it can be established what is, and what is not, an instance or example thereof.
- A standards organization defines industry-specific terminology to facilitate global trade and harmonize communication across different regions and languages.

### Notes

Defining concepts accurately is a foundational step in the curation process, as it establishes a common understanding of key terms within the community. A well-defined terminology ensures that individuals within the community can communicate effectively, resolve ambiguities, and work towards shared [objectives](@essif-lab) with precision.
