However, it is a common belief that if one uses a <a title="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used to represent Concepts." href="/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/term">term</a> to refer to a <a title="Concept: a Semantic Unit that captures the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;)." href="/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/concept">concept</a> in its <a title="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/tev2-specifications/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a>, the other will then relate it to &#x27;the same&#x27; <a title="Concept: a Semantic Unit that captures the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;)." href="/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/concept">concept</a> within its own knowledge, that we should not assume actually exists.

However, others need to hallucinate as to what that <a title="Concept: a Semantic Unit that captures the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;)." href="/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/concept">concept</a> might be, and typically respond by thinking that the <a title="Concept: a Semantic Unit that captures the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class &#x27;the same&#x27;)." href="/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/concept">concept</a> that the <a title="Term: a word or phrase (i.e.: text) that is used to represent Concepts." href="/tev2-specifications/docs/terms/term">term</a> refers to in their own <a title="Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party." href="/tev2-specifications/framework/docs/terms/knowledge">knowledge</a> would be its intended meaning.
