# Scope

### Summary
A **scope** is the extent of the [terms](@), [definitions](@) and other documentation that a [community](@) (which we call the [owner](@essif-lab) of the [scope](@)) needs to express, communicate and validate its [knowledge](@essif-lab) as relevant to achieving a specific subset of its [objectives](@essif-lab).

Other documentation includes [curated texts](@), and artifacts that are generated from that, such as [glossaries](@), [dictionaries](@) and the like. It also includes [tags](@) that can be used e.g. to refer to other [scopes](@) ([scopetags](@)), identify different versions for artifacts ([versiontags](@)), or create particular groups of [terms](@) ([grouptags](@)).

[Scopes](@), that is: their contents, must be [curated](@). Since this requires particular capabilities that the [owning community](terms-community@) may lack, we say that this [curation](@) is done by a so-called [terms community](@), whose members are individuals that do have such capabilities; they serve the [owning community](terms-community@) as the [curators](@) of the [scope](@).

A [scope](@) can contain multiple [terminologies](@); it is expected that at least one such [terminology](@) is committed to by the [owning community](terms-community@).

[Scopes](@) may overlap, or be nested, in a similar way as [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace).

The [terminology pattern](pattern:terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose

The purpose of having [scopes](@) is that it enables [communities](@) (and other [parties](@)) to come to develop and maintain [terminologies](@) that are not only relevant for realizing specific [objectives](@essif-lab), but also are fit for expressing and communicating the [knowledge](@essif-lab) that is used for doing so. This is known as [curation](@) of a [scope](@). Specifically, [scopes](@) provide the members of the [owning community](terms-community@) (but also non-members) to establish a provable similar understanding of the [concepts](@) and other [semantic units](@), which is prerequisite for fruitful cooperation, and realizing [objectives](@essif-lab).
