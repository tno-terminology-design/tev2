# TEv2 Text Conversion Tools

A **TEv2 Text Conversion Tool** is a [TEv2 tool](@) whose purpose is to convert particular text constructs (such as [TermRefs](@) or [MRGRefs](@)) that exist in one or more files with other texts, the contents of which consists of some fixed construct that is populated with elements derived from existing text constructs and/or other resources.

Examples of such [tools](tev2-text-conversion-tool@) include the [TRRT](@) and the [HRGT](@).

All [text conversion tools](@) follow the same [pattern for converting texts](/docs/overview/tev2-text-conversion). This implies that each of them

- has a specific [interpreter profile](@) and a specific [converter profile](@) and
- can be configured using a predefined or custom [interpreter](@) and [converter](@) that match these profiles respectively.
