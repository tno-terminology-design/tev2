# Provisional MRG Entry

A **Provisional MRG entry** is an [MRG entry](@)-under-construction that is part of one [provisional MRG](@); it contains 'raw' data that documents (the [semantic unit](@) referred to by) a [term](@), that is obtained either from (the [header](@) of) a [curated text](@), or from an [MRG entry](@) of some existing [MRG](@); this 'raw' data needs further processing in order to become valid for inclusion in an [MRG](@). This further processing is described in the [MRGT specifications](mrgt#post-processing@).
