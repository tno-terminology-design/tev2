# TEv2 Toolbox

The **TEv2 Toolbox** is the collection of tools designed to support and facilitate the process of terminology management following the [TEv2 specifications](/docs/overview). These tools assist [curators](@) in various tasks related to the curation, creation, and maintenance of terminological assets.

The TEv2 Toolbox includes essential tools such as the [MRG Importer](@), [HRGT](@), [MRDT](@), [HRDT](@), [MRGT](@), [ICT](@), [TRRT](@), but there may be others. Each tool serves a specific purpose in the overall terminology management process, contributing to the efficiency and accuracy of the curation workflow.

## Description

The TEv2 Toolbox provides valuable support for converting various raw texts, including markdown and LaTeX documents, into well-structured and formatted texts suitable for static website pages or PDF files. [Curators](@) and contributors can utilize these tools to create both [human-readable glossaries (HRGs)](hrg@) and [machine-readable glossaries (MRGs)](mrg@) from [curated texts](@).

## Functionality

The tools within the TEv2 Toolbox serve multiple functions, including:

1. [MRG Importer](@): Obtains local copies of all [MRGs](@) available in specified [scopes](@), streamlining access to relevant [glossaries](@).
2. [HRGT](@): Converts raw markdown texts into [formatted texts](@), ensuring better accessibility and readability.
3. [MRDT](@): Assists in creating [MRDs](@) from various [MRGs](@) (and possibly [curated texts](@)).
4. [HRDT](@): Supports the creation of [HRDs](@) with detailed explanations and context.
5. [MRGT](@): Enables the generation of [MRDs](@) from [curated texts](@) (and existing [MRGs](@) from other [scopes](@)).
6. [ICT](@): Ensures the conformity of various files to their [TEv2 specifications](/docs/specs/files), maintaining data integrity.

The TEv2 Toolbox empowers [curators](@) to streamline the terminology management process, ensuring the creation of accurate, accessible, and well-structured terminological assets that align with the [objectives](@) of the community or project involved.

## Examples

1. A collaborative research project uses the TEv2 Toolbox to convert raw markdown texts into a human-readable glossary, making the curated content accessible to all stakeholders.
2. A technical standards organization leverages the MRG Importer to import relevant machine-readable glossaries from other scopes, enriching their own terminology with industry-specific terms.

## Notes

- The TEv2 Toolbox represents a significant advancement in the field of terminology management, simplifying the creation and maintenance of terminological assets.
- It promotes consistency and accuracy across curated glossaries, enhancing communication and understanding within the community or project.
