# Moustache Variable

A **moustache variable** is a placeholder in the form of a 'moustache' tag, e.g.: `{{variable_name}}`, that are used by [converters](@) to produce a text by which a text construct that is located by an [interpreter](@) will be replaced.

## Notes

- Moustache variables serve as dynamic placeholders that allow flexible text transformation based on extracted information.
- The use of moustache variables enables separation of concerns between data extraction and text conversion.
