# Contributor

A **Contributor** is a person that contributes to the creation and maintenance of a [terminology](@) all [terms](@) of which have a [definition](@) that links these [terms](@) with a [criterion](@) that is used within the [scope](@) of that [terminology](@) for determining whether or not something is an instance (example) of the [semantic unit](@) to which the [term](@) refers.

Contributers typically assist the [curators](@) of such [terminologies](@). They may be [authors](@) (which helps them to make contributions that fit the texts that they author), but that is not a requirement.
