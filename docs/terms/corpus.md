# Corpus

## Short Description
The **Corpus** or **Corpus of Terminology** is the documentation that describes the [knowledge](@essif-lab) around a set of [terms](@) and [concepts](@). It is typically governed by conventions that are specified by a group of [terms communities](@), such as [TOIP's Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700).

The [terminology pattern](pattern:terminology@) relates this concept with other terminological [concepts](@).

## Purpose
The purpose of having a [corpus](@) is that it allows for the development of tools that support [authors](@) and groups of people to better communicate, by enabling them to refer to the [definition](@) of a [term](@) whenever that [term](@) is used. This is particularly beneficial when a specific [term](@) can be interpreted in different ways (according to different [definitions](@)).

Tools that we envisage will query for [terms](@) from the [corpus](@), and use that e.g. to create a custom [glossary](@) document, a [terminology](@) appendix in a paper you write, or as a resource from which you generate pop-up balloons in a website you create.
