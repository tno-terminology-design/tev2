# Sorter

A **sorter** is a specification, in the form of a predefined value or a [handlebars template](@), of the value that is to be used for sorting a list, e.g., for sorting [HRG entries](@) within a [HRG list](@).

The [specifications](toolbox@) of the particular [tool](text-conversion-tool@) will tell you whether or not sorting is necessary and if so, which [sorters](@) are predefined for that [tool](text-conversion-tool@). Note that [sorters](@) can use [moustache variables](@) that are specified in the [converter profile](@) of that tool.

:::info Editor's note
We could perhaps add references to appropriate sections of relevant tools, so that readers can see examples of this.
