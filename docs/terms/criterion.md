# Criterion (a.k.a. Criteria)

A **Criterion** is a text that people can evaluate to base a judgment or decision on. 

The term **criteria** has been used [for quite a few decades](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criteria), not just as the plural form, but also as a synonym of 'criterion'. We have conformed to this habit, and will use the term 'criteria' for both the singular and plural forms.

Within our context, [criteria](@) are used as parts of [definitions](@), each of which consists of (at least) one [term](@) (that refers to some [semantic unit](@)) and a [criterion](@) that people can use to determine whether or not something is an instance (or example) of that [semantic unit](@).
