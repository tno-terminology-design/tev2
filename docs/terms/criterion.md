# Criterion

A **Criterion** is a text that people can evaluate to base a judgment or decision on.

Within our context, [criteria](@) are used as parts of [definitions](@), each of which consists of (at least) one [term](@) (that refers to some [semantic unit](@)) and a [criterion](@) that people can use to determine whether or not something is an instance (or example) of that [semantic unit](@).

While the term [criteria](@) is officially the plural form of [criterion](@), in practice it is also used as a synonym of [criterion](@) (see, e.g., [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criteria)).
