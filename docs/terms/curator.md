# Curator (of a Scope)

A **Curator** is a person responsible for curating, managing, and maintaining [terminologies](@), to ensure shared understanding among a [community](@) working together on a particular set of [objectives](@essif-lab). They carefully select, organize, and present the [terminology](@), ensuring that the [definitions](@) are clear, precise, and reflect the [community's](@) agreed-upon understanding of the [concepts](@) (and other [semantic units](@)) they use.

### Examples

- The curator of a software development team ensures that for a particular software product (the [scope](@) of the team), all technical and non-technical [terms](@) and their [definitions](@) are consistently used, promoting coherence and reducing ambiguity during collaboration. Different products ([scope's](@) may have different (internally coherent) [terminologies](@). If the software development team works on different products, they may need different [terminologies](@) to be [curated](@), and possibly ensure that these [terminologies](@) get harmonized. Here, too, the curator plays a crucial role.
- The curator of a project team  ensures that all technical and non-technical [terms](@) and their [definitions](@) that are relevant within the [scope](@) of that project are coherent, and consistently used within (written) project deliverables. This not only promotes coherence and reduces ambiguity during collaboration, but it also makes it easier for readers to understand the content of the project deliverables. It also facilities inter-project communications and knowledge exchange.
### Notes

Curators play a vital role in the success of a terminology management initiative. By curating the [terminology](@) with precision and ensuring shared understanding among community members, they contribute to effective communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the [community](@).
