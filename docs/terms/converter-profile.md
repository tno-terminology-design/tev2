# Converter Profile

A **converter profile** is the specification of a class of [data objects](handlebars-object@), instances of which are used by the [text conversion tools](@) to generate text fragments from. [Converter profiles](@) exist, e.g., for the [TRRT](@) and the [HRGT](@).

The text fragments that are generated by the [text conversion tool](@) are created by executing a (predefined, or custom) [handlebars template](@) that works on a [converter profile object](@). The object defines the available information that [converters](@) and their [helper functions](@) can use to create texts.

The generic workings of [converter profiles](@) is documented in the [TEv2 Text Conversion pattern](/docs/overview/tev2-text-conversion).

## Converter Profile Object {#object-spec}

The [converter profile object](@) can be envisaged as a YAML object, that has a number of sections. Every [converter profile object](@) has the following sections, but individual [text-conversion-tool](@) may specify additional sections (or fields), which can be found in the section "Converter Profile" of their specifications.

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `int`   | (interpreter): includes the interpreter type `int.type` (either the name of a predefined interpreter, or "custom"), and the regex used to locate the reference `int.regex`. The `noRefs` helper, for instance, accesses the `int.regex` to be used as the default type. |
| `ref`   | (reference): the set of properties derived from the [named capturing groups](@) by the [interpreter](@). |
| `entry` | (MRG entry): all fields from the specific [MRG entry](@) that was selected. | 
| `mrg`   | (MRG): all fields from the [terminology section](mrg#terminology@) of the [mrg](@) from which the [MRG entry](@) was taken. |
| `err`   | (error): various fields, as specified below, that can be used to construct output that helps users identify an error, and fix it. |

Fields from the `entry` section may also be used in [converters](@) without specifying `entry` as a prefix (e.g., `entry.term` becomes `term`). Properties of `entry` with identical names to sections of the [converter profile object](@), are overwritten by the defined sections.

### `err` fields

When a file is being processed by a [text conversion tool](@), it can happen that an input structure is found that cannot be associated with an [MRG entry](@). The `err` section in a [converter profile object](@) contains fields that can help construct outputs that help users to identify, and fix, such errors, as follows.

<details>
  <summary>Legend</summary>

1. **`Field`** contains the field name;
2. **`Req'd`** specifies whether (`Y`) or not (`n`, or `F`) the field is always populated, or optional.
3. **`Description`** specifies the meaning of the field, and other things you may need to know, e.g. why it is needed, a required syntax, etc.

| Field           | Req'd | Description |
| --------------- | :---: | :---------- |
| `file`          |   Y   | Name of the file, including the extension, where the specific reference was found. |
| `dir`           |   Y   | Relative directory path from the location the tool was called to the directory where the `file` was found. |
| `line`          |   Y   | Linenumber in the file where the reference was found. |
| `pos`           |   Y   | Position on the line of the start of the reference that was found. |
| `cause`         |   n   | A description of the cause of a possible error. |
