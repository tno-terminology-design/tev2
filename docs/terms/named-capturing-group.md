# Named Capturing Group

A **Named Capturing Group** is a sub-pattern within a [regex](@) (called a '[capturing group](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Capturing_group)') that has been given a name, allowing one to refer to that sub-pattern. 

It depends on the [regex](@) flavor what the syntax is for specifying named capturing groups. 

Within [TEv2](@), we use the [JavaScript flavor (ECMAScript)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), which has specified a [syntax for named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group).
