# Showtext

The **Showtext** of a [TermRef](@) is its first part, i.e., the word or phrase that needs to refer to a particular [concept](@) (or other [semantic unit](@)), and that the reader will see in some marked up way, and that will be rendered such that it provides additional help for [readers](@) to (better) understand the intention of its [author](@).

Further information can be found in the documentation of [TermRef](@), as well as in the specification of the [TermRef syntax](/docs/specs/syntax/term-ref-syntax).
