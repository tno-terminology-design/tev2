# Body

A [body](@) is the part of a [curated text](@) that contains arbitrarily structured documentation about the [semantic unit](@) that the [curated text](@) documents.

Bodies live either in [curated text files](@) (behind the [header](@)), or in separate so-called [body files](@).

# Curated Text
A curated text starts with three dashes `---`.
This indicates the start of its (YAML) header.
Typically, the [header](@) consists of a sequence of key-value pairs.
The [header](@) is terminated with another three dashes and a new line.

The [body](@) of the [curated text](@) 

- either starts behind the header block.
  It is typically markdown, but other constructs may be inserted
  that contribute to the rendering of these texts in a (static) website.
  An example of this is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
  A discussion on these other constructs is outside the scope of this document.
- or it is located in a separate `[body file](@)`
  that is located somewhere within the [scopedir](@).
  In this case, the [header](@) must contain a field `bodyFile`
  that specifies the location (relative to the [scopedir](@)) of that file.

The [body](@) of a [curated text](@) can either be stored 

- in the [curated text file](@), which would then contain the entire [curated text](@), or
- as a separate [file](body-file@) (somewhere within the [scopedir](@)), in which case the [header](@) (that is in the [curated text file](@)) must contain a field `bodyFile` that specifies the location of the [body file](@).
