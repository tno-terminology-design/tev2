# Backgrounds

[Many cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Comparable_myths) have stories, similar to that of the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), that observe that the big feats, such as building a "tower, whose top may reach unto heaven", cannot be achieved unless there is linguistic unity. While this is generally recognized (the [EU parliament building](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/e3de7793-c11c-4246-81aa-401be9b09384/d5ttx0w-7bcf343b-2114-46cd-8c30-d722a9725ee9.jpg/v1/fill/w_1054,h_758,q_70,strp/european_union_parliament_02__tower_of_babel__by_nixseraph_d5ttx0w-pre.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD0xNTk2IiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvZTNkZTc3OTMtYzExYy00MjQ2LTgxYWEtNDAxYmU5YjA5Mzg0XC9kNXR0eDB3LTdiY2YzNDNiLTIxMTQtNDZjZC04YzMwLWQ3MjJhOTcyNWVlOS5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MjIxNyJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.db-z1OueDUGbAWMhnIbxcDioaFh1zJVlBnUTNAd5y5Y) in Strasbourg [resembles](https://jdreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tower-painting-parliament-e14176743284401.jpg.webp) the Tower of Babel as [depicted by the painter Bruegel](https://mattbell.org/wp-content/uploads/Tower-of-Babel-Peter-Breughel.jpg)), one can also observe that the part of the people that care about achieving a workable 'linguistic unity' lack easy-to-use means and tools.

The traditional tool for fostering common understanding is using [glossaries](@) or [dictionaries](@), such as the [Oxford English Dictionary (OED)](https://www.lexico.com/definition/glossary), the [Sovrin Glossary](https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/) and the [NIST Glossary](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary). Other initiatives produce documents with explanations, e.g. the [terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization](https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf) by Pfitzmann and Hansen (2010), or the [EBSI Terminology](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EBP/EBSI+Terminology) (login required).

Traditional tools usually come with drawbacks that reduce their practical usefulness in this electronic era. [Dictionaries](@) leave their user to decide which of the various meanings that a term may have was intended. [Glossaries](@) typically provide a single meaning for a term, but lack a specification of the scope/context in which it is applied or where it is authoritative. And documents rarely explain the ideas (concepts) behind terms they use.

The eSSIF-Lab terminology effort is an attempt to improve on this, by

- creating and using tools that help authors and readers to understand the texts the create/read;
- creating and maintaining a [Terminology Corpus](corpus@) that documents such understanding;
- automatically regenerate artifacts such as [glossaries](@) or [dictionaries](@)) as the [corpus](@) is being updated.
