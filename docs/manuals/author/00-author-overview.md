[Authors](@) create and maintain documents (e.g. articles, specifications, [curated texts](@) and other documentation). Their primary task/responsibility with a [community](@) is to provide actual content for these documents, without having to bother about the 'details' like layout, how it is all rendered (processed to produce human readable artifacts such as static websites, PDFs, whitepapers etc. [Authors](@) are provided the means to mark-up [terms](@) in their texts with a easy to type reference to its meaning/definition, the effect of which becomes apparent in the rendered artifacts created from that text. These effects, such as popups (in a static website) that show the definition of the [term](@) used, or an automatically generated [glossary](@) that can be used as an appendix in a paper, makes it easier for [readers](@) to understand what the [author](@) means to convey with the texts (s)he has written.

[Authors](@) may also identify any specific needs or mechanisms that help them do the aforementioned tasks, and communicate these needs to their [curators](@), or otherwise contribute to the further development of [TEv2](@) so that such needs and mechanisms may be supported.

One purpose of the Terminology Engine (v2) is to provide terminological support for people that [author](@) documentation, specifications, whitepapers, articles and the like. This document provides guidance for [authors](@) to make use of that support.
